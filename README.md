## Features
- Easily manage Redbox kiosk inventory with a streamlined interface.
- Search and update movie titles and barcodes effortlessly.
- Generate and assign new barcodes for new movie discs.

## Usage
Before you get started, you'll need to make sure Python is installed on your system and Powershell administrator is available.

Then, simply clone this repository, open the folder, and run the `init.ps1` Powershell script to launch the GUI! It's recommended that you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed for easy usage.
```bash
./init.ps1 # start the program
```

If you'd like to integrate this project in your own system, you can skip the initialization screen by providing the configuration data manually. To do this, use the following command:
```bash
./title.ps1 -Config "your json config here..." # launch the title manager
## OR ##
./barcode.ps1 -Config "your json config here..." # launch the barcode manager
```
